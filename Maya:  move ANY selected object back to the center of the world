Maya: move ANY selected object back to the center of the world
Here it is my solution: 
- create a MEL tab and copy/paste this snippet:

// Get the selected object(s)
string $selectedObjects[] = `ls -sl`;

// Check if any objects are selected
if (size($selectedObjects) > 0) {
    // Loop through each selected object and move it to the origin
    for ($obj in $selectedObjects) {
        // Move the object to the origin using -rpr to preserve the parent transformation
        move -rpr 0 0 0 $obj;
    }
    print("Selected object(s) have been moved to the center of the world.\n");
} else {
    print("No object selected. Please select an object to center.\n");
}


This script does the following:


1. `ls -sl` lists the currently selected objects and stores them in the `$selectedObjects` array.
2. It checks if any objects are selected using the `size($selectedObjects)` function.
3. If objects are selected, it iterates through each object in the array.
4. The `move -rpr 0 0 0 $obj;` command moves each object to the origin, preserving the parent transformation.
5. If no objects are selected, it prints a message prompting the user to select an object.

Hope this helps others too!
