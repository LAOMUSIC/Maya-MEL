## Script Descriptions

Here are brief descriptions of some of the scripts available in this repository:

1. **AutoRig.mel**: Automates the rigging process for biped characters. It creates a full rig setup including IK/FK switches, controls, and constraints.

2. **MeshCleaner.mel**: Cleans up the mesh by removing unused vertices, edges, and faces. It also checks for non-manifold geometry and other common mesh issues.

3. **AnimationExporter.mel**: Exports animation data from Maya to various formats compatible with other software. It supports exporting to FBX, BVH, and more.

4. **LightSetup.mel**: Sets up a standard three-point lighting system in the scene. Ideal for quick rendering setups and previews.

5. **UVUnwrapper.mel**: Automates the process of UV unwrapping for selected objects, optimizing the UV layout for minimal distortion.
